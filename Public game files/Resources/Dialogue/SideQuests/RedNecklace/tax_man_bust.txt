    Shrewd:Ah, you have a sharp eye!
    Shaggy:I... I have?
    Shrewd:Yes, I see you looking at my bust
    he hurry ups towards the bust and picks it up
    Shrewd:It was a gift from a very important man
    Shrewd:It is made from elephant tusk and sculpted by an renowned artist
    Shaggy:Oh, wow! Who's bust is it?
    Shrewd:A very important person, I can assure you that ... I think
    Shaggy:I see ... Can I take a closer look?
    Shrewd:By all means. Art is supposed to be looked at
    looking closer at it, it is clearly made out of wood
    painted whit an off white color
    the only impressive part is that it is carved from only one block of wood
    so it seems like nothing can be hidden inside
    Shaggy:* so the necklace it's not here *
    Shaggy:Ehm... Indeed very impressive
    Shrewd:Indeed it is
    Shrewd:But no matter what you say to me, I will not sell it to you
    Shaggy:oh, man... what a shame

{
    you shake a bust intensely
    nothing can be heard from inside
    the necklace is not here
