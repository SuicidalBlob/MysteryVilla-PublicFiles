    Shrewd:Those are the stuff I confiscated from the people who couldn't pay their taxes
    Shaggy:Can I look through them?
    Shrewd:They will go on auction soon anyways
    Shrewd:So I don't see any problem
    Shrewd:Maybe you will even buy something
    Shrewd:But I will keep an eye on you so you won't steal anything
    you search through the pile of objects
    no matter where you look, the necklace is nowhere to be found
    Shaggy:* of course he wouldn't let me search though this if he put the necklace here *
    Shaggy:* so it's not here *
    without realizing, your hand touched a spherical object
    it is white with sharp, small corners
