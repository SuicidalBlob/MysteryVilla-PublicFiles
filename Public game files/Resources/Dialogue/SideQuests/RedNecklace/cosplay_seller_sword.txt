    Hana:It was too big to be called a sword
    Hana:Massive, thick, heavy, and far too rough
    Hana:Indeed, it was a heap of raw iron
    Scooby:* I can show you something massive, thick and raw * He he he
    Shaggy:If it's so pure iron, how can it stay on that shelves
    Hana:Because it's not real, silly
    Hana:It's a replica
    Shaggy:Can I try it?
    Hana:Sure
    you take the sword in your hands
    for being a replica, it's still heavy
    you swing it from side to side, in an attempt to look cool
    you don't
    Shaggy:* hmm... I don't think it has anything hidden inside *
    Shaggy:* I don't see any panels anywhere anyway *
    Shaggy:* I don't think the necklace is hidden here *

{
    indeed, it was just a heap of raw foam
    still no necklace in sight
