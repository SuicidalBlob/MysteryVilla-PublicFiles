    Thorn:So it really was him. It's such a shame
    Thorn:I'll have to find a way to punish him. Maybe some public exposure would do it
    Shaggy:He may actually like it
    Thorn:Oh, he won't, I assure you

    Thorn:She did, didn't she?
    Shaggy:Please be kind to her. She just is miserable without you and that no touching rule
    Thorn:No, no. I see this was just my ego getting in my way
    Thorn:I'll think of a suitable punishment for her. One she will adore
    Thorn:so I can make up for lost time

    Shaggy:I don't think she realized how important it was for you
    Thorn:That's true. I'll have to think of a appropriate punishment for her

                    Thorn:And I respect that

                    Thorn:When she first came here, she was in a really bad place
                    Thorn:So I took her in and made everything in my power to make her be comfortable in her skin
                    Thorn:But somewhere along the way, she became dependent on me for her to be happy
                    Thorn:While I'm happy she's is not in that place as before, I feel like she uses me a crutch
                    Thorn:This is why I send her to our sex shop to work there separately from me
                    Thorn:She wasn't happy, but I promised her a present every time she visit
