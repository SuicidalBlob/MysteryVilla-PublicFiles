Anisa:Do you like it? It's Mistress Thorn's band logo
Anisa:It became later the logo for the academy
looking at it, it's plastic-ish shell with neon red letters on it

while Anisa isn't looking you take a look behind it
there is nothing hidden behind or inside
Shaggy:Damn! There's nothing here
Shaggy:It usually works
(c Anisa show)
Anisa:Did you say something, sir?
Shaggy:Ah... No! Didn't say anything
