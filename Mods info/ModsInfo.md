For a mod to be viable, it needs to be in a folder inside the "Mods" folder. If the "Mods" does not exists, create it. The name of the mod is the name of the folder in which is in. How should the folders look:

    >Mystery Villa (game folder)
        >Mods
            >mod 1
                >mod 1 files 1
                >mod 1 files 2
                > ...
            >mod 2
                >mod 2 files 1
                >mod 2 files 2
                > ...

You can find some mods examples inside the "Mod examples"
    
What you can't do at the moment:
* create complex animations. only simple "slideshows" that fade in/out. Example is the shower scene with Velma
* create intractable objects in the room or buttons. You can go to a new room if you created a "back" image, but won't have any buttons. only feasible for dialogue background
* create new mini games.
